# Python_Data_Analysis_Music__And_Academics
This is my final project for the Python and Data Analytics class. In this data analysis, I aim to find the relationship between music participation, and academic grades for secondary school students.

My goal in analyzing this data is to approach it from a perspective of having to convince a school board to continue funding the school music programs. As someone who has taught privately for years now, and had a short period of teaching at a public school, this topic is something I am particularly interested in, and feel is important.

My data came from a study located at this link: https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-34936-001.html. I took the data from it and created my own CSV file with it, which I only did because I couldn't find any comparable datasets anywhere else. Although I looked at other projects and resources for similar datasets, most of what I found wasn't as informative as I'd have liked it to be.

I tried to really take the time to plan out what I wanted to do before rushing into coding. This meant taking the time to plan out how I wanted to organize my data in the CSV file, and then how I wanted to analyze it. Even though it was easy to feel overwhelmed and try to cram in as much code in as possible, I really tried to present the data in the best and most effective way possible.

My first graph is a simple histogram I created for two of the most important categorical values in the dataset, which I discovered after doing some statistical analysis on the data.

My second and third graphs are vertical bar graphs, which I felt represented the data in the most clear way, which along with the colors made it clear what I was trying to achieve in terms of the difference in grades. 

My fourth graph is a horizontal bar graph, which I think works nicely with each individual color to demonstrate which percentage of effectiveness was highest, and for what subject.

I do feel that my analysis was fairly successful, and I feel that I owe a lot of that to the wonderful study that was conducted. However, I would have really liked to continue down the road of further analyzing, especially exploring regression and more detailed analyzing. I may go ahead and improve the project when I have some extra time!
